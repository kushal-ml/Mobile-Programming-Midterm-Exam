•	For question 1, I have created a calculator app whose screenshots are attached above
•	For question 2, I have created an interest calculator that calculates SI and CI, which options can be chosen from the spinner.
•	For question 3, I have created a simple activity where the user can select what he wants to calculate, i.e., the calculation (+,-,*,/) or Interest(SI or CI); when the user clicks on either button, the activity will open that particular app. 
•	After solving Q1 and Q2 separately, I integrated them into a single project whose code I uploaded to Git Hub and attached below. 
•	Project contains –
 MainActivity.kt, Calculator.kt, and Spinner.kt, where the functioning of the app is coded.
Activity_mail.xml, calculator.xml, and spinner.xml where the UI of the app is coded
AndroidManifest.xml, where all activities are connected to each other
Strings.xml, which contains options for spinner.
